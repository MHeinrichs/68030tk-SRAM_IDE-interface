**************************  Errors and Warnings  ***************************

WARNING:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will
   use the default filename of 'RAMCtrl.ise'.
INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'clk' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P22'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly
   in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.
WARNING:Cpld:1007 - Removing unused input(s) 'A<14>'.  The input(s) are unused
   after optimization. Please verify functionality via simulation.
WARNING:Cpld:1007 - Removing unused input(s) 'A<15>'.  The input(s) are unused
   after optimization. Please verify functionality via simulation.
WARNING:Cpld:1007 - Removing unused input(s) 'A<8>'.  The input(s) are unused
   after optimization. Please verify functionality via simulation.
WARNING:Cpld:828 - Signal 'Mtrien_Dout.CE' has been minimized to 'VCC'.
     The signal is removed.
ERROR:Cpld:853 - Insufficient number of product terms.  This design needs at
   least 387 but only 360 left after allocating other resources.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
